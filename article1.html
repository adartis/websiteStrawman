      <h1>The Illusion of Activity: <span style="font-weight:300;">Rethinking Pace, Priorities, and Progress</span></h1>
      <p><strong>In a world that prizes hustle, agility, and rapid responsiveness,</strong> it is easy to conflate motion with momentum.</p>
      <p>But as many experienced managers and policy leaders know, <em>activity does not always equate to progress</em>; under certain conditions, <strong>rapid activity can diminish real-world impact.</strong></p>

      <p><em>A useful metaphor comes from physics: the Euler’s Disk.</em> This fascinating object spins with increasing speed and noise just before stopping completely. At a glance, it appears to accelerate—yet it is actually <strong>losing energy</strong> and preparing to collapse.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Displacement versus Activity</h2>
      <p>The more frequently one acts, and the more priorities one juggles, <strong>the less displacement</strong> (that is, real forward movement) is achieved.</p>

      <p>There is a connection between:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The frequency of action</strong> (task switching, reactive activity, overcommunication)</li>
        <li><strong>The number of priorities</strong> (parallel projects, competing goals)</li>
        <li><strong>The size of the change</strong> you want to see in the world</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Put simply:</strong> the busier you are, the less you may be achieving.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why This Matters for Management</h2>
      <p>This is <strong>not</strong> a case against work, responsiveness, or ambition. It is a critique of <strong>undisciplined activity</strong>.</p>

      <p>In high-functioning organisations – particularly in government, perhaps the most complex industry for managing expectations – there is a tendency to try to do more with less.</p>

      <p>Without strategic focus, <em>this becomes noise without signal</em>.</p>

      <p>Instead of doing more, organisations should <strong>reconsider how resources are deployed</strong>, and focus on a handful of objectives that will improve the overall system of delivery.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Most Important Programmes Deserve Slower Thinking</h2>
      <p>It may seem paradoxical, but the most ambitious programmes—those with accelerated timelines or complex delivery requirements—<strong>demand fewer distractions and more sustained attention</strong>.</p>

      <p>These efforts require:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Longer thinking cycles</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Tighter resource alignment</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Clearer communication boundaries</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p>When everything is urgent, <strong>nothing is truly important</strong>. When every initiative gets equal attention, <em>none are sufficiently nourished to succeed</em>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What This Does Not Mean</h2>
      <p>This is <strong>not</strong> an argument to slow everything down or stop work altogether. Organisations should remain responsive, energetic, and goal-driven. But <em>they must be discerning</em>.</p>

      <p>High-priority, accelerated programmes should not be treated like everything else. They <strong>warrant protected attention</strong>, slower decision cycles, and <strong>greater managerial patience</strong>.</p>

      <p>In fact, the more urgent the work, <strong>the more it needs space and focus</strong> to succeed.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Conclusion: Less Frequency, More Force</h2>
      <p><strong>Effective management is not about doing everything.</strong> It is about knowing what to focus on, what to delay, and what to drop.</p>

      <p>In today’s fast-moving environment, it is tempting to fill the calendar and tick off tasks. But <strong>real change requires sustained effort, not scattered energy</strong>.</p>
